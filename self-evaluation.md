# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?
This will help with making multiple adjustments or inputs at once vs one at a time.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? 
How to complete the commands from .each thru to end and knowing what goes in between.
How will you do that?
Lots of practice and knowing how to manipulate with the correct verbage.
- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?
Trial and error.  II had to try over and over again on a few challenges to make sure I did it correctly.  After one worked it was easy to go back and see what mistakes I had made before.
